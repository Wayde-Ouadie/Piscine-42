# Piscine-june-2021
Here you can find all the projects that I validated during my Piscine at 1337 School.

This repo includes my work done during the 4 weeks piscine of 1337 school (part of 42 network), thanks to my efforts and my work during it I got accepted in the school after finishing 8 projects(Shell projects and from C00 to C06).

# Purpose

This git repo provides useful tips to understand how to achieve 100 at your projects and exams. However one should not memorize answers if not properly understood.

# How can it help you?

You can take a look on this repo in order to practice and remember:

- Don't push your exercises with the main function if they ask you to write only a function
- Add a main.c file to exercises that are only functions (if you want to compile while practicing).
- Create exercises inside the correct folders with the correct names before asking the machine to correct your exercises.
- Practice, practice, practice, and good luck.
